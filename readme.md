# Mood Meter
This is a simple web application that allows users to track their emotions using a mood meter chart. The application takes two inputs from the user: energy level and pleasantness level, and plots the results on the mood meter chart. The mood meter chart is a simple two-axis graph that allows users to visualize their emotions in terms of energy and pleasantness.

## 👇What is a mood meter?
A mood meter is a tool that can be used to help people identify and understand their emotions. It typically consists of a chart or diagram that divides emotions into different categories, such as "happy," "sad," "angry," or "anxious," and allows individuals to plot their current emotional state on the chart.
